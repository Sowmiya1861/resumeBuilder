                1. Start with a strong resume summary or objective. This is a short statement at the top of your resume that summarizes your experience and presents your most important skills.
                <br> <br>
                2. List your relevant work experience. Include job titles, employers, dates of employment, and a brief description of the duties and accomplishments for each job.
                <br> <br>
                3. Include your educational background. Include the name of the degree, major, school, and year of graduation.
                <br> <br>
                4. Add additional sections. You may want to include volunteer experience, certifications, awards, or other relevant information.
                <br> <br>
                5. Use keywords. Many employers use computer programs to scan resumes for keywords related to the job you are applying for. Make sure to include relevant keywords in your resume.
                <br> <br>
                6. Proofread your resume. It is important to make sure there are no typos or errors in your resume. It is a good idea to have someone else review your resume for accuracy.
